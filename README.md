# Genetic_Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a nature-inspired optimization method. Mimicking evolution, it evolves a population of solutions over generations, selecting and combining them to solve complex problems. Applied in diverse fields, GAs excel in tasks like parameter tuning and feature selection, making them a potent tool in computational optimization.
