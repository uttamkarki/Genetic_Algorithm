# Genetic Algorithm (GA)

The Genetic Algorithm is a versatile optimization technique inspired by natural selection. It evolves populations of potential solutions over generations to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex problems.

## Algorithm Workflow

1. **Initialization:** Generate an initial population of individuals with random or heuristic values.

2. **Evaluation:** Calculate fitness scores for each individual using a predefined fitness function that measures solution quality.

3. **Selection:** Choose individuals for reproduction based on their fitness scores. Popular methods include roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, and rank-based selection.

4. **Crossover:** Combine genetic material from selected individuals to create offspring. Common strategies include one-point, two-point, and uniform crossovers.

5. **Mutation:** Introduce genetic diversity by randomly modifying individual components of the offspring with a predefined mutation rate.

6. **Replacement:** Replace the current population with the newly generated offspring, creating the next generation.

7. **Termination:** Repeat steps 2-6 for a fixed number of generations or until a termination criterion (e.g., solution convergence) is met.

8. **Result:** The algorithm converges towards better solutions with each generation. The final solution is the individual with the highest fitness score.

## Usage and Integration

1. **Define Objective:** Formulate your optimization problem with a fitness function that quantifies solution quality.

2. **Configure Parameters:** Set algorithm parameters like population size, mutation rate, and termination criteria.

3. **Implement Algorithm:** Adapt the provided example code or integrate the algorithm into your project.

4. **Evolve Solutions:** Run the algorithm to evolve populations, selecting parents, performing crossovers, and applying mutations.

5. **Analyze Results:** Examine convergence behavior, solution quality, and adapt parameters as needed.
